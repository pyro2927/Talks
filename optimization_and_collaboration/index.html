          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Work at Evolve Labs, primarily Rails developer, with some system administration mixed in.
          </p>
          <img src="./imgs/evolve_spoon.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            Here in Minneapolis. Work on software that makes gaming better. Stuff like VoIP, peer-to-peer chat, game tracking, etc.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Java -> PHP -> HTML/CSS -> iOS -> Android(Java... again) -> Ruby
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Haven't always been a ruby dev. Call me a language-slut if you wish
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Evolve Team</h2>
          <img src="./imgs/evolve_team.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            Provide background to explain our setup, I'm primary Rails dev but Sam pitches in. Blair helps lead roadmapping.
            Other 2 guys are C++ devs primarily.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src="./imgs/share_load.jpg">
          <aside class="notes">
            Share the load, AKA allow <b>everyone</b> to participate.
            PRs, coding, testing, roadmapping, whatever
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Share the Load</h2>
          <p>
            Make it easy for everyone. Don't be the sole gatekeeper.
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Gatekeeper == bottlekneck
            GitHub has everyone deploy on their first day. Strive for low-friction contributions. Setup Capistrano on day 1 and let junior devs and non-devs deploy.
            Also works as a least common-denominator. If you make stuff so easy a non-dev can use it, you'll only help yourself in keeping things easy.
            For a while I was the only dev who knew how to restart our production servers.
            "Hit by a bus" stuff.

        <section>
          <h2>Prioritizing Tasks</h2>
          <p>
            Roadmap, and stick to it.
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Tasks are listed chronologically, easy to see if one developer is ahead of another and needs to "jump back" to lend a hand.
            IE: If I need to go back and help Sam with Ruby stuff, or if he needs to do the same for HTML/CSS work for me.
            Hardest part for me is sticking to a release schedule.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Roadmap</h2>
          <img style="height: 600px" src="./imgs/roadmap.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            We use Confluence/Jira.
            Nice to use a tool dedicated to roadmapping, easy to navigate and use.

        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>"Not in this release"</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            Often hear, "Not in this release".
            Sometimes you don't get to work on the fun pieces.
          </aside>

            Things that may be easy for a Rails developer, may not be easy for one of their teammates

        <section>
          <h2>Dev Environment</h2>
          <p>
            Vagrant + Ansible
          </p>
          <img src="./imgs/vagrant_chilling.png">
          <p>
            Development environment setup with a single command:<pre>vagrant up</pre>
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Big benefit to using Ansible is that we can re-target a "cloud" server to prepare a machine for production use.
            I like the old Vagrant logo better

          <h2>PR Handling</h2>
          <p>

          <p>
            (and feel free to ocassionally <strike>nag</strike> remind)
					</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            One question I get often is "what is the best way to handle PRs?".
            Hold people accountable, give them direct responsibility.
            Even if there are a few people on a team, assign our PRs.
            Threaten to merge after a day or two.
            "I know it works, I'm going to merge it in tomorrow if no one else reviews it"

            Bad PR

          <img src="./imgs/good_pr.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            Good PR vs bad PR
            Good to include a picture, inline is even nicer.

          <aside class="notes">
            Great PR!
            Include documentation on how to run tests, even if it's just <pre>bundle exec rspec spec</pre>
            We complain all the time about something being thrown "over the wall", don't do that to another dev.

            Especially when it is a FE change
          </aside>

        <section>
          <h2>Pair Programming</h2>
          <p>
            Done ad-hoc, organized via Slack/chat.
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Be humble, it's OK to admit when you are having trouble with something.
            <br/>
            Usually involves cross-collaboration between BE/FE devs

        <section>
          <h2>Tabs or Spaces?!?!</h2>
          <p>
            Spaces, obviously.
					</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Developers can disagree on code styles, editors, OSs, all sorts of things.
            Consistency is key

          <h2>Code Style</h2>
          <p>
            Decided by majority, enforced via <a href="http://editorconfig.com">EditorConfig</a>.
					</p>
          <img src="./imgs/editorconfig.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            Majority can be outweighed by a senior developer. Easy to combined mulitple types of styles into a single <pre>.editorconfig</pre>.
            Allows developers to use whatever tools they want while still adhearing to the same code standards.

          <h2>EditorConfig Plugins</h2>
          <img style="height: 600px" src="./imgs/editor_config_plugins.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            Emacs, Vim, Visual Studio, SublimeText and TextMate
            Supported by all main editors. If you're fancy enough to use something more obscure, you're probably good enough to just follow the code style-guide.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Code for the Edge Case</h2>
          <p>
            Find situations where code WON'T work.
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Turn it into a game. Sometimes it is easier to find a problem in someone else's code rather than your own.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Seeds are Your Friend</h2>
          <p>
            Populate the development database with a metric shit-ton of data.
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Coded a "past" view, once we seeded 5000 records, it took over 2 minutes to render the page. Forces devs (FE and ruby) to consider controller views. Things like pagination become clear. You'll find areas you need to add caching or other helpful things.

					<h2>Don't Trample Each Other's Work</h2>
					<p>
            Tests will ensure nothing breaks.
					</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Setup a system that alerts you immedietly upon breakage. Notifications and automated tests are wonderful.
            Rails developers don't need to be told to use tests, but once you start interacting with developers you might find one who hasn't heard of tests before.
          </aside>

					<h2>Super Tests!</h2>
					<p>
            Rspec, FactoryGirl, VCR, Simplecov, and Ladle
					</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Basic setup, simplecov to ensure code coverage, Ladle allows quick and easy LDAP usage without cluttering actual LDAP installation.

					<h2>SimpleCov</h2>
          <img src="./imgs/simplecov.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            We don't strive for 100%, but we try to get high and make sure the potential problematic areas well.

					<h2>Travis-CI</h2>
          <img src="./imgs/github_travis.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            "How many people have had a breaking change merged into master?"
            Keep notifications automated and asyncronous. Troublesome area is keeping the noise-to-signal ratio low. For now we keep a separate channel in Slack.
            Integrate it into your workflow.
            Sometimes not running tests can be a slippery slope
          </aside>

				<section>
					<h2>.travis.yml</h2>
          <pre>
language: ruby
rvm:
  - 2.2.1
bundler_args: "--without production"
script:
  - rake db:test:prepare
  - bundle exec rspec spec
before_script:
  - psql -c "CREATE USER evolve WITH SUPERUSER" -U postgres
before_install:
  - sudo apt-get update
install:
  - sudo apt-get install default-jre-headless
  - bundle install --without production
          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            Using Travis-CI makes sure that we don't have any one-off dependancies met because tests are run in a fresh container each time. Scripts must be complete!
            before_script and install sections end up looking a lot like our Ansible script
          </aside>

					<h2>Get Notified</h2>
          <img src="./imgs/travis.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            Travis runs on each commit and alerts us in Slack if something breaks.
            W/ Slack notifications, it is kinda a "set it and forget it" model.
            Enjoy using Travis because tests run in "clean" containers each time, and keeps things compartmentalized.

					<h2>Keep Tests Snappy!</h2>
          <img src="./imgs/rspec_results.png">

            Extra tid-bit, keep tests fast. Fast tests will get run more often.

					<h2>config.before(:suite)</h2>
          <p>
            Switching out in place of config.before(:all) reduced test time by 75%
          </p>
